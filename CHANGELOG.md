## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `docs/templates/` containing seven amended project-specific document templates:
  `decision-record`, `qa-strategy`, `screenplay-guide`, `stack-architecture`, `backlog`,
  `implementation-log`, and `changelog`
- Added populated live docs: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/screenplay-guide.md`,
  `docs/qa-strategy.md`, `docs/backlog.md`
- Added `CHANGELOG.md`
- Added `docs/implementation-logs/2026-06-02_phases-1-3.md` recording the Phase 1–3 session

- Added `docs/implementation-logs/2026-06-02_live-smoke-test.md` recording the first live run against a public Magento sandbox (Magebit), validating the methodology and identifying new blockers
- Added backlog Items #8 (browser-lifecycle defect — fixed), #9 (order-scenario tagging + smoke profile — done), and #10 (live-run selector/timeout drift), discovered by the live smoke test
- Added `@placesOrder` tag to the two order-placing scenarios in `features/guest-checkout.feature`
- Added a `smoke` profile to `cucumber.js` (`tags: 'not @deferred and not @placesOrder'`) for safe read-only runs against shared stores
- Added a `test:smoke` npm script (`cucumber-js --profile smoke`) (backlog Item #7)

### Changed

- Changed `README.md` — replaced the "Running the suite" placeholder with documented run paths: the live read-only smoke (`BASE_URL=https://magento2-demo.magebit.com npm run test:smoke`, including the tag-scoping safety note and a Windows PowerShell variant) and the Docker full-suite path; added the `npx playwright install chromium` step, a "Continuous integration" section, and an updated "Status" reflecting the validated live methodology (backlog Item #7)

- Changed `src/hooks/browser.hooks.ts` — launch the browser once in `BeforeAll` and close it in `AfterAll`, keeping `engage(Cast.where(...))` per-scenario in `Before`. Fixes a lifecycle defect where only the first scenario per run passed and all others failed at first navigation with "Target page, context or browser has been closed" (backlog Item #8)
- Changed `src/interactions/CartPage.ts` — `proceedToCheckoutButton` now uses `button[data-role="proceed-to-checkout"]` instead of the ambiguous `button.action.primary.checkout`, which also matched the header mini-cart button and caused a Playwright strict-mode violation on live Luma (backlog Item #10)
- Changed `src/interactions/CheckoutPage.ts` — `placeOrderButton` scoped to `.payment-method-content` to remove the same latent selector ambiguity (backlog Item #10)
- Changed `src/hooks/browser.hooks.ts` — added `setDefaultTimeout(30 s)` so live Magento steps (network + Knockout.js re-renders) no longer hit Cucumber's 5 s default (backlog Item #10)
- Changed `src/tasks/ProceedToCheckout.ts` — checkout email-field wait raised to `Wait.upTo(20 s)` for the heavy Knockout.js checkout render (backlog Item #10)
- Changed `docs/adr/0002-use-serenity-js.md` — corrected the browser-hook example and accompanying note, which previously showed the per-`Before` launch/close pattern (proven defective by Item #8) and asserted it was canonical; now shows the launch-once `BeforeAll`/`Before`/`AfterAll` pattern (backlog Item #5)

- Changed `docs/gherkin-style-guide.md` — replaced the before/after worked-example placeholder with a real refactor: a bloated imperative scenario rewritten into the actual `Complete a guest order with valid details` scenario, with commentary mapping each change to a documented principle (backlog Item #6)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-02

Screenplay layer implementation — all tasks, interactions, questions, and step definitions.

### Added

- Added `src/questions/CartItemCount.ts`, `CartSubtotal.ts`, `OrderConfirmation.ts`, `ValidationMessage.ts`
- Added `src/hooks/browser.hooks.ts` — Playwright browser launched and torn down per scenario via Cucumber `Before`/`After` hooks; resolves `Cast.where` synchronous constraint

### Changed
